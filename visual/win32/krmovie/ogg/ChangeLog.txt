Version 0.85.17777 - 12.01.2011

    * Fixed project configuration which referenced two CRT versions in output binaries.
      The above issue created faulty binaries for Windows XP and it was due migration
      to Visual Studio 2008.

       be broken.
    * Added "controls" attribute to HTML5 <video> ActiveX plugin

    * Released Windows CE decoder package, no WebM/VP8 support for now, only Ogg Vorbis,
      Theora, FLAC and Speex decoders.
    * Fixed a bug in Theora DirectShow encoder filter when multiple encoder filters were used
      in the same graph

Version 0.84.17338 - 20.07.2010

    * Updated webmdshow to 0.9.9.0
    * Fixed installer script regarding URL registration 
      (fixes "Open URL..." in Windows Media Player)

    * Updated libvorbis to version 1.3.1
    * Updated libogg to version 1.2.0
    * Ogg Demux filter has been changed from a source + parser filter to just parser filter. This step allows usage of 
      DirectShow's "File Source (Async.)" filter which can handle files bigger than 2GB, or "File Source (URL)" which
      gives better networking support (proxy, ipv6, etc.)
    * HTML5 <video> plug-in has received a couple of improvements:
        - URI support given by uriparser library
        - VMR9 support (instead of VMR7), this requires DirectX9
        - Internet Explorer Standards mode support, instead of just Quirks mode
        - width and height basic attribute support
    * Removed OGM decoding support

    * Added support for Theora 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 color sampling formats.
    * Added HTML5 <video> tag support for Microsoft Internet Explorer. This component is not enabled by default in the
      installer and it is only a technical preview - only basic playback (play/pause by left click button), no seeking, no
      controls and no HTML5 <video> interfaces support.
      To use it this functionality in Internet Explorer simply add xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/video" to the 
      <video> tag.
    * Added 7.1 channels support for FLAC and support for files bigger than 2GBytes.
    * Prefixed all DirectShow filters with "Xiph.Org". This should simplify usage for GraphEdit/GraphStudio users.

Version 0.73.1936 - 21/10/2006

This version mainly exposes encoding options for all the codecs as COM interfaces, and as property pages
(viewable in graphedit).  Still needs more testing and error checking. Fixed a bug with flac that caused silence 
when a track automatically repeated. The aspect  ratio handling in theora is now correct, the channel order in 
vorbis is now correct. And now explorer has the "Add to WMP playlist" option,  which other media files have in 
their right-click menu.

    * Encode options for theora, vorbis, speex and flac and property pages in graphedit
    * Improved OGM decoding
    * Improved subtitle support
    * Vorbis channel order fixed
    * 24/32 bit >2 channel decode support improved for vorbis and flac
    * Fix end of file/repeat bug in flac
    * Correct handling of aspect ratio in theora
    * "Add to playlist" option for WMP appears in explorer right-click menu 
    

Version 0.72.1838 - 17/9/2006

Major changes in this version include, updating all the code to Visual Studio 2005. There is now a "working" 
port for Windows Mobile 5.0  as at this revision, this is not yet released. Many minor bugixes and compatability 
fixes, dependancy updates, speed increases, unicode support, improved installer. Some major work was done to 
maintain Windows 9X/ME support while properly supporting unicode. If you use or have an  interest in the 
maintaining of support for these obsolete operating systems, please let me know whether they are working 
for you.

    * Fixed bug that would refuse to play extremely small files
    * Added YUY2 output support to better support old graphics hardware
    * Updated speex to 1.2beta1
    * Updated project to VS 2005
    * Using theora-exp for theora decoding ~30% speed up
    * Improved 24/32 bit support for FLAC (still may not be perfect)
    * All code moved to unicode. Fixed bug which would fail if paths had unicode chars
    * Custom unicode emulating(unicows) CRT's to maintain Windows 9X support
    * Compatablity fixes for Media Portal and Media Player Classic
    * Installer detects and offers to remove previous versions
    * Installer offers to optionally associate WMP to .ogg
    * MMX optimisations for libtheora ported to MASM, encoding ~25-30% faster
    * Xiph fish icon in explorer
    * Code ported to Windows Mobile 5.0 (currently unreleased build)
    * Switch to integer decoding version of speex 

Version 0.71.0946 - 24/02/2006

More bugfixes, particularly to theora. See 0.70 release for more details about recent changes. Docs and source 
package will be updated on the weekend, there's no major changes there from 0.70. This version is fairly stable 
now it seems.

    * Fixed the theora seeking bug, should accurately seek to any frame without artefacts.
    * Fixed bug not handling WMP doing hardware video acceleration, caused crash on some files (Thanks slashdot!)
    * Fixed handling of missing 3xx http response codes
    * Fixed bug where player would crash if you dragged it from one monitor to another while playing
    * Fixed COM reference double-release bug
    * Fixed race condition which could crash or hang sometimes after a seek. 

Version (0.70.0827) - 16/02/2006

Wow... has it been a whole year :) Yes, this project is still alive! There's a fair bit of new code, so if you have problems 
you might want to try the history page and get version 0.69. One notable thing that this new version does not do correctly, 
is it no longer handles chained icecast streams, but it handles streaming static files on a server much better. The previous 
solution for icecast was a real hack which is no longer possible, it will be fixed properly fairly soon.

I'm releasing now, because otherwise you'll be waiting forever! Releases should be coming much more frequently hopefully. 
As always, email me your bugs and feature requests. The unicode filenames will be fixed as soon as I can, sorry, I keep putting 
that one off.

    * Theora can seek without artefacts to any frame, even non-keyframes.(95% of the time, there's still a slight bug)
    * All seeking in all codecs is accurate to within a single audio sample (ie. sub-second)
    * Complete rewrite of demux, it's much easier for me to continue now.
    * OGM support is improved a bit, still not great. It does not associate with the .ogm extension to avoid messing with other 
       solutions for .ogm you might have. But renaming the .ogm file to .ogg it will attempt to play it.
    * Improved handling of static files on servers (still not seeking over http)
    * Be aware that it builds a seektable for all on-disk files. For really large files (>250MB) it may take a little while 
       for the file to load.
    * Updated most libraries, vorbis is still at 1.1.1, speex still 1.1.10. Another release soonish may rectify this. 
       I just want to release what I've got now, or it will keep being put off. 

Version (0.69.8924) - 15/02/2005

Lots of bufixes, especially memory leaks and memory management. Along with a new installer based on NSIS, which 
is just click-and-run.

    * Removed several major memory leaks in encoders and decoders
    * More intelligent buffer sizing, reduces memory footprint about 5-10 fold
    * Much more documentation
    * Vorbis encoder has programmatic interface for setting quality

Version 0.68.8333 - 06/12/2004

    * Fixed playback from windows network drives.
    * Fixed bug where audio would stop if you seek really close to the end.
    * Seeking performance back to almost instant.
