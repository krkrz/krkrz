Note that Visual Studio 2005 doesn't work with "Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET Framework 3.5 SP1",
I've got linking errors regarding "Strmiids.lib".

The following system environment variable BASECLASSES should point to the
DirectShow BaseClasses path e.g.:

Also make sure that in you have the Windows SDK include, library, and executable paths configured
in Visual Studio.

Windows Mobile
==============

Visual Studio 2005 Standard or Visual Studio 2008 Professional is required.

The following are needed to add Windows Mobile platforms in Visual Studio

- Windows Mobile 5.0 SDK for Pocket PC
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=83A52AF2-F524-4EC5-9155-717CBE5D25ED&displaylang=en

- Windows Mobile 5.0 SDK for Smartphone
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=dc6c00cb-738a-4b97-8910-5cd29ab5f8d9

http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=06111A3A-A651-4745-88EF-3D48091A390B&displaylang=en

The order of installation is important, otherwise all the vcproj files would be
changed upon load:

1. Windows Mobile 5.0 Pocket PC SDK (ARMV4I) - "Windows Mobile 5.0 SDK for Pocket PC.msi"
2. Windows Mobile 5.0 Smartphone SDK (ARMV4I) - "Windows Mobile 5.0 SDK for Smartphone.msi" 
3. Windows Mobile 6 Professional SDK (ARMV4I) - "Windows Mobile 6 Professional SDK Refresh.msi" 

Or alternatively you can modify the "%VCINSTALLDIR%\vcpackages\WCE.VCPlatform.config" xml file and change
the order of SDKs there.
